  My fear exactly. God knows what Chinese plastic is made of. They make imitation Native American jewelry out of some sort of weird plastic in China and ship it here, along with phony gold coins. Probably flip-flops and Minute Rice, as well. But in the end, I'm more concerned with the same, awful and fishy/moldy smell I'm starting to get in the water half the time when I open a "fresh" 16 oz. bottle of Ice Mountain water. The filtered tap water coming through my fridge, despite the crummy way they use tons of chlorine to purify it, is vastly superior. I drink lots of water and like the small bottles, so I'll have to buy some, and discard the ones that don't work out. They can join all the other Chinese crap, toasters and tea kettles, that I've had to throw away. </p>

<p> Don't buy it! Seriously. Too wide to travel in your car cup holder. You have to hold your head in a specific position for it to work. At the end of the bottle, take sip straw thing away so you can finish the bottle. What a waste. I left my liter Seriously Safe Stainless Steel bottle somewhere & was looking for a replacement. I can't seem to find them anywhere. Ughh! </p>

<p>New design disappoints!!! The actual rubber straw tops comes off too easily and is hard to get on the exact way to prevent leaks and prevent air from being trapped. My 2 year old can pull the spout off with his mouth and it can be knocked off easily- I have had several bottles w the old design without any issues like this </p>
